ifconfig -l

# The ifconfig utility displays the current configuration for a network
# interface when no optional parameters are supplied.

# The -l flag may be used to list all available interfaces on the system,
# with no other additional information.  Use of this flag is mutually
# exclusive with all other flags and commands, except for -d (only list
# interfaces that are down) and -u (only list interfaces that are up).
